This is still an issue in 2017, I hope it will help somebody out there! 
I found 2 possibilities to create working jar-s under IntelliJ 2017.2

File -> 
Project Structure -> 
Project Settings -> 
Artifacts -> 
Click green plus sign -> 
Jar -> 
From modules with dependencies ->
Select the main class, and be sure to change the manifest folder ->

You have to change manifest directory:
Project_Folder_Name\src\main\java 

replace "java" with "resources"
Project_Folder_Name\src\main\resources

To build your artifact go to build artifacts and choose "rebuild". 
It will create an "out" folder with your jar file and its dependencies.

To Test:

Go to the jar file directory and type:
java -jar Jar_File_Name.jar
